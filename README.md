Implementing Artistic Neural Style Transfer on Images & Videos 

Jupyter Notebooks:

	[1] Style-Transfer-Keras.ipynb: Keras version as described here - https://keras.io/examples/neural_style_transfer/

	[2] Style-Transfer-PyTorch.ipynb: PyTorch version as described here - https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/neural_style_tutorial.html

	Note: PyTorch implementation requires that both content and style files have same dimensions.. 

	Directory ./pytorch contains few sample content and style files resized for PyTorch, as well as the outputs generated on those..

	[3] Output-Visualization.ipynb: Creates visualization of style transfer output in grid format, using MatPlotLib and PyPlot

	Note: some of the notebooks may be too large in size to open in browser..

Directory /styles contains sample style files

Directory /sample-images contains few sample images to test style-transfer

Directory /styled-output contains output of style-transfer on sample images
