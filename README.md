Implementing Artistic Neural Style Transfer on Images & Videos using Keras & Tensorflow

Jupyter Notebooks:

	Style-Transfer-Keras.ipynb: Implements neural style transfer using Keras as described here - https://keras.io/examples/neural_style_transfer/


	Style-Transfer-TensorFlow.ipynb: Implements neural style transfer using TensorFlow as described here - https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/tutorials/generative/style_transfer

	Output-Visualization.ipynb: Creates visualization of style transfer output in grid format, using MatPlotLib and PyPlot

	Note: some of the notebooks may be too large in size to open in browser..

Directory /styles contains sample style files

Directory /sample-images contains few sample images to test style-transfer

Directory /styled-output contains output of style-transfer on sample images
